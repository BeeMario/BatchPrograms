Some apps me and Carnel made in batch lmao

Here is each of them and what they do:
Clock.bat (made by me) - A fully functional clock that can track seconds and even milliseconds. Also the window title of this app is the date!
troll.bat (made by carneliantius) - Deletes System32 with no prompt (Do NOT run on your real machine and run in a virtual machine instead because it can trash your system especially if you are on windows XP)
